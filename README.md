2. In the [`angle-berry-server`](https://github.com/babakfp/angle-berry-server) directory, open a terminal and run the following command to start the server: `pnpm serve`.
3. Once the server is running, copy the domain address displayed in the terminal. For example, it might be `http://127.0.0.1:8090`.
4. Update the value for `PUBLIC_POCKETBASE_URL` in the [`.env`](./.env) file with the copied domain address.

## Todo

-   BUG: When sending a new message in the chat and immediately attempting to edit it, the message content is not automatically written in the input box. This issue seems to be related to the "bind" keyword. However, it is important to note that this functionality works fine for old messages.
