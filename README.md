# Angle Berry (Client)

## Development

To set up the development environment for your project, follow these steps:

1. Duplicate the `.env.example` file located in the root of your project and rename the duplicate file to `.env`.
2. In the `angle-berry-server` directory, open a terminal and run the following command to start the server: `serve`.
3. Once the server is running, copy the domain address displayed in the terminal. For example, it might be `http://127.0.0.1:8090`.
4. Update the values for `POCKETBASE_URL` and `PUBLIC_POCKETBASE_URL` in the `.env` file with the copied domain address.

You have now completed the necessary steps to set up your development environment using Pocketbase with SvelteKit.
